        <h2>We did it boys, racism is no more.</h2>
        <p>
            My fellow Americans, due to the overwhelming amount of Black squares teenage girls are posting on Instagram, the supreme
            court has decided end racism completely. We did not think you would go to such extreme measures but you have very much
            proved your point. The Military will be told to stand down just please stop. Thank you

        Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my house. "What
        the devil?" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead
        on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I
        have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, "Tally ho lads" the grape shot
        shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified
        rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up.
        Just as the founding fathers intended.
